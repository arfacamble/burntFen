    <p> You might be surprised to find out that organic farming does use chemical pesticides. The pesticides that organic farmers used in the 80s are illegal now, and the pesticides organic farmers use now will quite possibly be illegal in organic farming in the years to come. Biodynamic farming uses no pesticides but rather designs crop cycles to promote maximum soil health.</p>

    <p> Here you can see a picture of our beautiful bee-hive. There's no lid for us to take off and steal honey because this is here only to tempt in free pollinators. Big ups to the ecosystem yeah?!</p>
